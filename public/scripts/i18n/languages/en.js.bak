    "faq_q1": "What is DropShare?",
    "faq_a1": "DropShare is a web application that allows you to easily share files between devices connected to the same network. It uses WebRTC technology to create a direct connection between devices, allowing for fast and secure file transfers without storing your files on any server.",
    "faq_q2": "How does DropShare work?",
    "faq_a2": "DropShare works by creating a local peer-to-peer connection between devices on the same network. When you open DropShare in your browser, it automatically discovers other devices running DropShare on the same network. You can then select a device and send files or messages directly to it.",
    "faq_q3": "Is DropShare free to use?",
    "faq_a3": "Yes, DropShare is completely free to use. There are no hidden fees, subscriptions, or premium features. The service is supported by minimal non-intrusive advertisements.",
    "faq_q4": "Do I need to create an account to use DropShare?",
    "faq_a4": "No, DropShare doesn't require any account creation or sign-up process. You can start using it immediately by opening the website in your browser.",
    "faq_q6": "Which browsers are supported?",
    "faq_a6": "DropShare works on all modern browsers that support WebRTC, including:\n- Google Chrome (desktop and mobile)\n- Mozilla Firefox (desktop and mobile)\n- Microsoft Edge\n- Safari (iOS 11+ and macOS 10.13+)\n- Opera",
    "faq_q7": "Can I use DropShare if devices are on different networks?",
    "faq_a7": "No, DropShare requires all devices to be connected to the same local network (same Wi-Fi or LAN). This is because DropShare uses local network discovery to find other devices. If you need to share files between devices on different networks, you might need to use a VPN or alternative file sharing solutions.",
    "faq_q8": "Is there a file size limit?",
    "faq_a8": "There's no hard limit on file size in DropShare. However, practical limits depend on your browser's memory constraints and network speed. For very large files (over 1GB), you might experience performance issues or timeouts depending on your device and network conditions.",
    "faq_q9": "What types of files can I share?",
    "faq_a9": "You can share any type of file using DropShare, including:\n- Images (JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.)\n- Documents (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, etc.)\n- Videos and audio files\n- Archive files (ZIP, RAR, etc.)\n- Executable files",
    "faq_q10": "Are my files stored on your servers?",
    "faq_a10": "No, DropShare never stores your files on any server. All transfers are direct peer-to-peer connections between devices. Your files are transferred directly from one device to another without going through an intermediary server.",
    "faq_q11": "Is my data encrypted during transfer?",
    "faq_a11": "Yes, all data transferred through DropShare is encrypted using the WebRTC protocol's built-in encryption. This provides a secure and private connection between devices.",
    "faq_q12": "Can other people on my network see my files?",
    "faq_a12": "Only the specific device you choose to send files to can receive those files. Other devices on the network can see your device name but cannot access any files unless you specifically send them.",
    "faq_q13": "What information does DropShare collect about me?",
    "faq_a13": "DropShare collects minimal information, including your device name and browser type to facilitate connections. This information is temporary and is only used while the application is running. For more details, please see our Privacy Policy.",
    "faq_q14": "I can't see other devices on my network",
    "faq_a14": "If you can't see other devices, try the following:\n- Make sure all devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network\n- Check if your firewall or antivirus is blocking WebRTC connections\n- Try using a different browser\n- Refresh the page on all devices\n- Some corporate or public networks might block the necessary ports for device discovery",
    "faq_q15": "File transfer failed or is very slow",
    "faq_a15": "If you're experiencing slow transfers or failures:\n- Check your network speed and stability\n- Try transferring smaller files first\n- Make sure both devices have stable connections\n- Close other bandwidth-intensive applications\n- Try moving devices closer to the Wi-Fi router",
    "faq_q16": "DropShare doesn't work on my device",
    "faq_a16": "DropShare requires a modern browser with WebRTC support. If it's not working, try:\n- Updating your browser to the latest version\n- Trying a different browser (Chrome or Firefox are recommended)\n- Checking if your browser has WebRTC enabled\n- Disabling any browser extensions that might interfere with WebRTC"
