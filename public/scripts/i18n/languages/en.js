    "faq_q1": "What is DropShare?",
    "faq_a1": "DropShare is a web application that allows you to easily share files between devices connected to the same network. It uses WebRTC technology to create a direct connection between devices, allowing for fast and secure file transfers without storing your files on any server.",
    "faq_q2": "How does DropShare work?",
    "faq_a2": "DropShare works by creating a local peer-to-peer connection between devices on the same network. When you open DropShare in your browser, it automatically discovers other devices running DropShare on the same network. You can then select a device and send files or messages directly to it.",
    "faq_q3": "Is DropShare free to use?",
    "faq_a3": "Yes, DropShare is completely free to use. There are no hidden fees, subscriptions, or premium features. The service is supported by minimal non-intrusive advertisements.",
    "faq_q4": "Do I need to create an account to use DropShare?",
    "faq_a4": "No, DropShare doesn't require any account creation or sign-up process. You can start using it immediately by opening the website in your browser.",
    "faq_q6": "Which browsers are supported?",
    "faq_a6": "DropShare works on all modern browsers that support WebRTC, including:\n- Google Chrome (desktop and mobile)\n- Mozilla Firefox (desktop and mobile)\n- Microsoft Edge\n- Safari (iOS 11+ and macOS 10.13+)\n- Opera",
    "faq_q7": "Can I use DropShare if devices are on different networks?",
    "faq_a7": "No, DropShare requires all devices to be connected to the same local network (same Wi-Fi or LAN). This is because DropShare uses local network discovery to find other devices. If you need to share files between devices on different networks, you might need to use a VPN or alternative file sharing solutions.",
    "faq_q8": "Is there a file size limit?",
    "faq_a8": "DropShare doesn't impose any specific file size limits. However, practical limitations may apply based on your browser's memory constraints and network speed. Very large files (multiple GB) might cause performance issues in some browsers. For optimal performance, we recommend keeping individual file transfers under 4GB, though many users successfully transfer larger files.",
    "faq_q9": "What file types can I share?",
    "faq_a9": "DropShare can transfer any file type, including:",
    "faq_a9_li1": "Images (JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.)",
    "faq_a9_li2": "Videos (MP4, MOV, AVI, etc.)",
    "faq_a9_li3": "Documents (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, etc.)",
    "faq_a9_li4": "Audio files (MP3, WAV, etc.)",
    "faq_a9_li5": "Compressed archives (ZIP, RAR, etc.)",
    "faq_a9_li6": "Any other file format",
    "faq_q10": "How fast are file transfers?",
    "faq_a10": "Transfer speeds depend on your local network capabilities. Since DropShare uses direct peer-to-peer connections within your local network, transfers are typically much faster than cloud-based services. On a modern Wi-Fi network, you can expect speeds comparable to copying files between devices using a USB drive. Gigabit networks can achieve transfer rates of 50-100MB/s or more for optimal conditions.",
    "faq_q11": "Is DropShare secure?",
    "faq_a11": "Yes, DropShare is designed with security in mind. All file transfers use WebRTC's built-in encryption protocols, ensuring that your data is protected during transit. Additionally, since files are transferred directly between devices on your local network without going through external servers, there's minimal risk of data interception or unauthorized access.",
    "faq_q12": "Are my files stored on DropShare servers?",
    "faq_a12": "No, DropShare does not store your files on any servers. Files are transferred directly from one device to another using peer-to-peer technology. Your files never leave your local network, and no copies are stored in the cloud or on our servers. This approach enhances both security and privacy.",
    "faq_q13": "What data does DropShare collect?",
    "faq_a13": "DropShare collects minimal data necessary for the service to function. This includes temporary technical information required for device discovery and connection establishment. We collect anonymous usage statistics to help improve the service, but we do not track personal information or the content of files being transferred. For more details, please refer to our Privacy Policy.",
    "faq_q14": "Can others on my network see my transfers?",
    "faq_a14": "While DropShare encrypts the file transfers between devices, the connection itself happens over your local network. In theory, someone with advanced technical skills and access to your network could potentially detect that a transfer is happening, but they would not be able to see the contents of the files due to the encryption. For highly sensitive data, we recommend using a trusted and secured network.",
    "faq_q15": "How does DropShare's encryption work?",
    "faq_a15": "DropShare utilizes WebRTC's built-in security features, which include:",
    "faq_a15_li1": "DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) for key exchange",
    "faq_a15_li2": "SRTP (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol) for data encryption",
    "faq_a15_li3": "End-to-end encryption ensuring only the intended recipient can decrypt the data",
    "faq_a15_p2": "These industry-standard protocols ensure that all data transferred through DropShare remains secure and private.",
    "faq_q16": "Why can't I see other devices?",
    "faq_a16": "If you can't see other devices, try these troubleshooting steps:",
    "faq_a16_li1": "Ensure all devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network or LAN",
    "faq_a16_li2": "Check if your network has client isolation or AP isolation enabled (this prevents device discovery)",
    "faq_a16_li3": "Verify that your browser supports WebRTC (all modern browsers do)",
    "faq_a16_li4": "Try refreshing the page on all devices",
    "faq_a16_li5": "Disable VPNs or proxy services that might interfere with local network discovery",
    "faq_a16_li6": "Some corporate or public networks may block the necessary connections",
    "faq_q17": "Why did my file transfer fail?",
    "faq_a17": "File transfers might fail for several reasons:",
    "faq_a17_li1": "Network interruption or instability",
    "faq_a17_li2": "One device lost connection or closed the browser",
    "faq_a17_li3": "The file might be too large for the browser to handle",
    "faq_a17_li4": "Browser memory limitations (especially on mobile devices)",
    "faq_a17_p2": "Try breaking large files into smaller parts, ensure stable network connections, and keep the browser windows active during transfers.",
    "faq_q18": "Can I use DropShare offline?",
    "faq_a18": "DropShare requires a local network connection between devices, but not necessarily an internet connection. As long as your devices are connected to the same local network (like a home Wi-Fi), DropShare will work even if there's no internet access. This makes it useful for sharing files in locations with limited or no internet connectivity.",
